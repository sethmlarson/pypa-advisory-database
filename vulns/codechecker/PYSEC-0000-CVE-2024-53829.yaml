id: PYSEC-0000-CVE-2024-53829
details: "CodeChecker is an analyzer tooling, defect database and viewer extension\
  \ for the Clang Static Analyzer and Clang Tidy. \nCross-site request forgery allows\
  \ an unauthenticated attacker to hijack the authentication of a logged in user,\
  \ and use the web API with the same permissions,\_including but not limited to adding,\
  \ removing or editing products. The attacker needs to know the ID of the available\
  \ products to modify or delete them. The attacker cannot directly exfiltrate data\
  \ (view) from CodeChecker, due to being limited to form-based CSRF.\n\nThis issue\
  \ affects CodeChecker: through 6.24.4."
