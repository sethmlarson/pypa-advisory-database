id: PYSEC-0000-CVE-2024-53829
details: "CodeChecker is an analyzer tooling, defect database and viewer extension
  for the Clang Static Analyzer and Clang Tidy. \nCross-site request forgery allows
  an unauthenticated attacker to hijack the authentication of a logged in user, and
  use the web API with the same permissions,Â including but not limited to adding,
  removing or editing products. The attacker needs to know the ID of the available
  products to modify or delete them. The attacker cannot directly exfiltrate data
  (view) from CodeChecker, due to being limited to form-based CSRF.\n\nThis issue
  affects CodeChecker: through 6.24.4."
