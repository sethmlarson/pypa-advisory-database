id: PYSEC-0000-CVE-2024-2928
severity:
- type: CVSS_V3
  score: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N
details: A Local File Inclusion (LFI) vulnerability was identified in mlflow/mlflow,
  specifically in version 2.9.2, which was fixed in version 2.11.3. This vulnerability
  arises from the application's failure to properly validate URI fragments for directory
  traversal sequences such as '../'. An attacker can exploit this flaw by manipulating
  the fragment part of the URI to read arbitrary files on the local file system, including
  sensitive files like '/etc/passwd'. The vulnerability is a bypass to a previous
  patch that only addressed similar manipulation within the URI's query string, highlighting
  the need for comprehensive validation of all parts of a URI to prevent LFI attacks.
