id: PYSEC-0000-CVE-2024-28179
severity:
- type: CVSS_V3
  score: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H
details: Jupyter Server Proxy allows users to run arbitrary external processes alongside
  their Jupyter notebook servers and provides authenticated web access. Prior to versions
  3.2.3 and 4.1.1, Jupyter Server Proxy did not check user authentication appropriately
  when proxying websockets, allowing unauthenticated access to anyone who had network
  access to the Jupyter server endpoint. This vulnerability can allow unauthenticated
  remote access to any websocket endpoint set up to be accessible via Jupyter Server
  Proxy. In many cases, this leads to remote unauthenticated arbitrary code execution,
  due to how affected instances use websockets. The websocket endpoints exposed by
  `jupyter_server` itself is not affected. Projects that do not rely on websockets
  are also not affected. Versions 3.2.3 and 4.1.1 contain a fix for this issue.
